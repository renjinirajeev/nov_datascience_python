# #collection :collection of hetrogeneous data

# value assign :-
#variables


#multiple values :-
# array : collection of homogeneous data
#         size of array is fixed---> drawback , to overcome this we use python collections


# 4 types of collections
# 1. List
# 2. tuples
# 3. set
# 4. dictionary

# 5 properties

# 1. How to define ?

# 2. Hetrogeneous data supported or not ?

# 3. Duplicates value allowed or not ?

# 4. Insertion order is preserved or not ?
# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] ---> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] --- preserved
# [9,10,3,2,1,4,5,7,6,8] --- not preserved

# 5. Mutable or imutable
# [1,3,4,5] --->5-->10 --- mutable , if not possible it is imutable
